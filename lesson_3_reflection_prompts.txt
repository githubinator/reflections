When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    I would want to use a remote repository if I want to collaborate with others on the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to keep control over my local repository.
