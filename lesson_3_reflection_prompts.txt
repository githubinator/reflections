When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    I would want to use a remote repository if I want to collaborate with others on the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to keep control over my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a GitHub repository wich is located on GitHub. It refers to the original repository.
    It should be used if you want to make your own changes to a repository without contributing
    to the original.
    A clone is a copy of a repository which is located on a local computer. It can be a copy of a
    local repository or a copy of a GitHub repository.
    It could for the same reason as a fork. But it does not refer to the original repository.
    A branch is a path of development inside a repository, which originates in a certain commit.
    It should be used for different developments inside a repository.
